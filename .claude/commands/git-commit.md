check working code very carefully before commit.
determine title analyzing the most significant things done in the changes
if you think that not all changes are related and some changes should not come to this commit then do not include those changes into this commit.
use prefix like fix: feat: chore: doc: etc in the title.
do not write large description. You don't have to write every code changes in the description. Keep description small and concise.
now commit changes
